To run the application locally, create database 'snakedb' in Postgresql and add table to it by running the script in snake-api/database.sql in Postgresql.

Then install the dependencies in snake-api by 'npm i' and run server by 'npm start'.

Do the same with frontend, install the dependencies in snake-ui by 'npm i' and run frontend by 'npm start'.
